## This repo is created for learning C
This is a personal learning project for me which includes basic program to some of the development using PIC Microcontroller
The basic c program include number string, recursion, arithmetic operation, swapping, etc..
The code using PIC Microcontroller(PIC16F877A) includes:
1. Basic LED operation
2. Pullup and pulldown
3. LCD 
4. PWM
5. ADC
6. UART
