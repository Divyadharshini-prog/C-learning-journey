# C-learning-journey

## This repo is created for learning C

This is a personal learning project for me which includes basic programs to some of the development using **PIC Microcontroller**.  
The basic C programs include working with numbers, strings, recursion, arithmetic operations, swapping, etc.

**PIC microcontrollers** typically have a small amount of on-chip RAM and flash memory, which can be expanded using external memory devices. They also feature a wide range of peripherals, including timers, analog-to-digital converters, and communication interfaces such as **UART**, **SPI**, and **I2C**.

### The code using PIC Microcontroller (PIC16F877A) includes:
1. Basic LED operation  
2. Pullup and pulldown  
3. LCD 16x2  
4. PWM  
5. ADC  
6. Keypad interface  
7. Seven-segment Display  
8. UART  
9. I2C

### Steps to run the code in VS Code:
1. Save the code in the desired location of your git repository.  
2. Then run these commands:  

```bash
gcc float_to_round.c -o float_to_round.exe             # This command creates an .exe file in the directory
.\float_to_round.exe                                   # This command executes the .exe file
```
