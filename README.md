# C-learning-journey
## This repo is created for learning C
This is a personal learning project for me which includes basic program to some of the development using PIC Microcontroller
The basic c program include number string, recursion, arithmetic operation, swapping, etc..
PIC microcontrollers typically have a small amount of on-chip RAM and flash memory, which can be expanded using external memory devices. PIC microcontrollers also feature a wide range of peripherals, including timers, analog-to-digital converters, and communication interfaces such as UART, SPI, and I2C.
The code using PIC Microcontroller(PIC16F877A) includes:
1. Basic LED operation
2. Pullup and pulldown
3. LCD 16x2
4. PWM
5. ADC
6. Keypad interface
7. Seven segment Display
8. UART
9. I2C

Steps to run the code in VS code:
1. Save the code in the desired location of your git repository
2. Then run this cmd example: 
'''
gcc float_to_round.c -o float_to_round.exe             // this command is for creating a exe file in the directory
'''
'''
.\float_to_round.exe                         //this command is for executing the exe file
'''
